[IMPORTANT]
====
If you create routes in Microsoft Azure through public endpoints, the resource
names are subject to restriction. You cannot create resources that use certain
terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-reserved-resource-name[Resolve reserved resource name errors]
in the Azure documentation.
