It is possible to sink events from an event source to a Knative Eventing channel.
Channels are Custom Resources (CRs) that define a single event-forwarding and persistence layer.
After events have been sent to a channel, these events can be sent to multiple Knative services by using a subscription.

The default configuration for channel instances is defined in the `default-ch-webhook` ConfigMap. However, developers can still create their own channels directly by instantiating a supported channel object.

== Supported channel types
Currently, {ServerlessProductName} only supports the use of InMemoryChannel channels as part of the Knative Eventing Technology Preview.

The following are limitations of InMemoryChannel channels:

* No event persistence is available. If a Pod is goes down, events on that Pod will be lost.
* InMemoryChannel channels do not implement event ordering, so two events that are received in the channel at the same time may be delivered to a subscriber in any order.
* If a subscriber rejects an event, there are no redelivery attempts. Instead, the rejected event will be sent to a _dead letter sink_ if this exists, or is otherwise dropped.

// TODO: Add link for dead letter sink docs once these are added.
