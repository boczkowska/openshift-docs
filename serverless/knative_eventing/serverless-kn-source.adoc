toc::[]

You can use `kn` to list and manage available event sources or event source types for use with Knative Eventing.
For information about installing `kn`, see xref:../installing_serverless/installing-kn.adoc#installing-kn[Installing Knative client].

Currently, `kn` supports management of the following event source types:

`ApiServerSource`:: Connects a sink to the Kubernetes API server.
`PingSource`:: Periodically sends ping events with a constant payload. It can be used as a timer.
`SinkBinding`:: Connects core Kubernetes resources like `Deployment`, `Job`, or `StatefulSet` with a sink.

// Additional sources can be added by the cluster administrator. For example, {ServerlessProductName} can be used with Kafka and Camel K event sources, which are installed using the Operator Hub in the {product-title} web console.
// For more information about adding event source types as a cluster administrator, see
// xref:../knative-client.adoc#knative-client[Installing Knative Client].
