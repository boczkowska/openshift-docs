{ServerlessProductName} simplifies the process of delivering code from development into production by reducing the need for infrastructure set up or back-end development by developers.

[id="how-it-works_{context}"]
== How {ServerlessProductName} works

Developers on {ServerlessProductName} can use the provided Kubernetes native APIs, as well as familiar languages and frameworks, to deploy applications and container workloads.

{ServerlessProductName} on {product-title} enables stateless serverless workloads to all run on a single multi-cloud container platform with automated operations. Developers can use a single platform for hosting their microservices, legacy, and serverless applications.

{ServerlessProductName} is based on the open source Knative project, which provides portability and consistency across hybrid and multi-cloud environments by enabling an enterprise-grade serverless platform.

// [id="serverless-ha_{context}"]
// == High availability in {ServerlessProductName}

// Active/passive high availability (HA) is a standard feature of Kubernetes APIs that helps to ensure that APIs stay operational if a disruption occurs.
// In an HA deployment, if an active controller crashes or is deleted, another controller is available to take over processing of the APIs that were being serviced by the controller that is now unavailable.

// Active/passive HA in {ServerlessProductName} is available through leader election, which is enabled by default after the Knative Serving control plane is installed.

// When using a leader election HA pattern, instances of controllers are already scheduled and running inside the cluster before they are required.
// These controller instances compete to use a shared resource, known as the leader election lock.
// The instance of the controller that has access to the leader election lock resource at any given time is referred to as the leader.

// HA functionality is available in {ServerlessProductName} for the `autoscaler-hpa` and `controller` components. These components are configured with two replicas by default.

// TODO: Add autoscaling mention; check in with PM on other topics

== Knative Eventing
A developer preview version of Knative Eventing is available for use with {ServerlessProductName}. However, this is not included in the {ServerlessOperatorName} and is not currently supported as part of this Technology Preview. For more information about Knative Eventing, including installation instructions and samples, see the link:https://openshift-knative.github.io/docs/docs/index.html[Knative Eventing on {product-title}] documentation.
