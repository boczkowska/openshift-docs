toc::[]

Knative Serving on {product-title} builds on Kubernetes and Kourier to support deploying and serving serverless applications.

It creates a set of Kubernetes custom resource definitions (CRDs) that are used to define and control the behavior of serverless workloads on an {product-title} cluster.

These CRDs are building blocks to address complex use cases, for example:
* Rapidly deploying serverless containers.
* Automatically scaling pods.
* Viewing point-in-time snapshots of deployed code and configurations.
