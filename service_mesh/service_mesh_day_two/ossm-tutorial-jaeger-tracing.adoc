Jaeger is an open source distributed tracing system. You use Jaeger  for monitoring and troubleshooting microservices-based distributed systems.  Using Jaeger you can perform a trace, which follows the path of a request through various microservices that make up an application.  Jaeger is installed by default as part of the {ProductShortName}.

This tutorial uses {ProductShortName} and the bookinfo tutorial to demonstrate how you can use Jeager to perform distributed tracing.

[NOTE]
====
The Bookinfo example application allows you to test your {ProductName} {ProductVersion} installation on {product-title}.

Red Hat does not provide support for the Bookinfo application.
