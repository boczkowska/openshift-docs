{odo-title-full} ({odo-title}) is a fast and easy-to-use CLI tool for creating applications on {product-title}. {odo-title} allows developers to concentrate on creating apps without the need to administrate an {product-title} cluster itself.
Creating deployment configurations, building configurations, configuring service routes and other {product-title} elements are all automated by {odo-title}.

Existing tools such as `oc` are more operations-focused and require a deep understanding of Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts. {odo-title} abstracts away complex Kubernetes and OpenShift concepts allowing developers to focus on what is most important to them: code.


== Key features

{odo-title} is designed to be simple and concise with the following key features:

* Simple syntax and design centered around concepts familiar to developers, such as projects, applications, and components.
* Completely client based. No server is required within the {product-title} cluster for deployment.
* Supports many languages and frameworks such as Node.js, Java, Ruby, Perl, PHP, and Python.
* Detects changes to local code and deploys it to the cluster automatically, giving instant feedback to validate changes in real time.
* Lists all the available components and services from the {product-title} cluster.
