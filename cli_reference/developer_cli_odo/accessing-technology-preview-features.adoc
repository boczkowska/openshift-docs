In `{odo-title}` you can access Technology preview in features, such as devfile support, by enabling the Experimental Mode.

`{odo-title}` supports both devfile components and S2I components in the Experimental Mode. You can use the same commands for both type of components but a devfile component has a higher priority. For example, NodeJS is accessible both as a devfile and an S2I component, but if you run `odo create nodejs` in the Experimental Mode, `{odo-title}` creates a devfile NodeJS component. The same behavior applies to other commands such as `odo push` and `odo url`. 

See the xref:odo-behavior-in-the-experimental-mode[table listing `{odo-title}` behavior in the Experimental Mode], to learn how different `{odo-title}` commands work.
