toc::[]

When {product-title} is installed on restricted networks, Operator Lifecycle
Manager (OLM) can no longer use the default OperatorHub sources as they require
full Internet connectivity. Cluster administrators can disable those default
sources and create local mirrors so that OLM can install and manage Operators
from the local sources instead.
