Virtual machines that use local volume storage can be moved so that they run on a specific node. 

You might want to move the virtual machine to a specific node for the following reasons:

* The current node has limitations to the local storage configuration.
* The new node is better optimized for the workload of that virtual machine. 

To move a virtual machine that uses local storage, you must clone the underlying volume by using a DataVolume. After the cloning operation is complete, you can xref:../../../cnv/cnv_virtual_machines/cnv-edit-vms.adoc#cnv-edit-vms[edit the virtual machine configuration] so that it uses the new DataVolume, or xref:../../../cnv/cnv_virtual_machines/cnv-edit-vms.adoc#cnv-vm-add-disk_cnv-edit-vms[add the new DataVolume to another virtual machine].
