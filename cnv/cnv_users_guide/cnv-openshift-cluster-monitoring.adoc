== Cluster logging

The cluster logging components are based upon Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK).
The collector, link:http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd], is deployed to each node in the {product-title} cluster.
It collects all node and container logs and writes them to link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] (ES).
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana] is the centralized, web UI
where users and administrators can create rich visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.
