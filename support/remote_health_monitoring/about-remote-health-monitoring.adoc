{product-title} collects anonymized aggregated information about the health, usage, and size of clusters and reports it to Red Hat via two integrated components: Telemetry and the Insights Operator. This information allows Red Hat to improve {product-title} and to react to issues that impact customers more quickly. This also simplifies the subscription and entitlement process for Red Hat customers and enables the {cloud-redhat-com} service to provide an overview of your clusters and their health and subscription status.

A cluster that reports data to Red Hat via Telemetry and the Insights Operator is considered a _connected cluster_.

ifdef::openshift-origin[]
{product-title} may be installed without a pull secret received at cloud.redhat.com. In this case default imagestreams will not be imported and telemetry data will not be sent.
