= Managing snapshot users

Depending on the cluster configuration, it might be necessary to allow
non-administrator users to manipulate the VolumeSnapshot objects on the API
server. This can be done by creating a ClusterRole bound to a particular user
or group.

For example, assume the user "alice" needs to work with snapshots in the cluster. The cluster administrator completes the following steps:

. Define a new ClusterRole:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ClusterRole
metadata:
  name: volumesnapshot-admin
rules:
- apiGroups:
  - "volumesnapshot.external-storage.k8s.io"
  attributeRestrictions: null
  resources:
  - volumesnapshots
  verbs:
  - create
  - delete
  - deletecollection
  - get
  - list
  - patch
  - update
  - watch
----

. Bind the cluster role to the user "alice" by creating a ClusterRole binding object:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterRoleBinding
metadata:
  name: volumesnapshot-admin
roleRef:
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
  kind: ClusterRole
  name: volumesnapshot-admin
subjects:
- kind: User
  name: alice
----

[NOTE]
====
This is only an example of API access configuration. The VolumeSnapshot objects behave similar to other {product-title} API objects. See the link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/admin/accessing-the-api/[API access control documentation] for more information on managing the API RBAC.
