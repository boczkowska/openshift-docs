= Creating a migration plan in the CAM web console

You can create a migration plan in the CAM web console.

.Prerequisites

* The CAM web console must contain the following:
** Source cluster
** Target cluster, which is added automatically during the CAM tool installation
** Replication repository
* If you want to copy your data by using snapshots, the source and target clusters must be running on the same cloud provider (AWS, GCP, or Azure) and in the same region.

.Procedure

. Log in to the CAM web console.
. In the *Plans* section, click *Add plan*.
. Enter the *Plan name* and click *Next*.
+
The *Plan name* can contain up to 253 lower-case alphanumeric characters (`a-z, 0-9`). It must not contain spaces or underscores (`_`).
. Select a *Source cluster*.
. Select a *Target cluster*.
. Select a *Replication repository*.
. Select the projects to be migrated and click *Next*.
. Select *Copy* or *Move* for the PVs:

* *Copy* copies the data in a source cluster's PV to the replication repository and then restores it on a newly created PV, with similar characteristics, in the target cluster.
* *Move* unmounts a remote volume (for example, NFS) from the source cluster, creates a PV resource on the target cluster pointing to the remote volume, and then mounts the remote volume on the target cluster. Applications running on the target cluster use the same remote volume that the source cluster was using. The remote volume must be accessible to the source and target clusters.

. Click *Next*.

. Select a *Copy method* for the PVs:

* *Snapshot* backs up and restores the disk using the cloud provider's snapshot functionality. It is significantly faster than the *Filesystem* copy method.
+
[NOTE]
====
The storage and clusters must be in the same region and the storage class must be compatible.
====

* *Filesystem* copies the data files from the source disk to a newly created target disk.

. Select a *Storage class* for the PVs.
+
If you selected the *Filesystem* copy method, you can change the storage class during migration, for example, from Red Hat Gluster Storage or NFS storage to Red Hat Ceph Storage.

. Click *Finish*.
. Click *Close*.
+
The migration plan appears in the *Plans* section.
