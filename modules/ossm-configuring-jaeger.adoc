= Configuring Jaeger

When the {ProductShortName} Operator creates the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource it also creates the Jaeger resource. The Jaeger Operator then uses this object when creating Jaeger instances.

The default Jaeger parameters specified in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` are as follows:

.Default Jaeger parameters
[source,yaml]
----
  apiVersion: maistra.io/v1
  kind: ServiceMeshControlPlane
  spec:
    istio:
      tracing:
        enabled: true
        ingress:
          enabled: true

.Jaeger parameters

|===
|Parameter |Description |Values |Default value

|tracing
   enabled
|This enables or disables tracing in {ProductShortName}. Jaeger is installed by default. If you do not want to install Jaeger, change the `enabled` value to `false`.
|`true`/`false`
|`true`

|ingress
   enabled
|This enables/disables ingress.
|`true`/`false`
|`true`

[id="ossm-configuring-jaeger-elasticsearch_{context}"]
== Configuring Elasticsearch

Jaeger can be configured for different storage backends:

* *Memory* - Simple in-memory storage, only recommended for development, demo, or testing purposes. This is the default option for the `AllInOne` deployment strategy. Do NOT use for production environments.
* *Elasticsearch* - For production use. This is the default option for the `Production` deployment strategy.

[NOTE]
====
The default template strategy in the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` resource is `AllInOne`. For production, the only supported storage option is Elasticsearch, therefore you must configure the `ServiceMeshControlPlane` to request the `production-elasticsearch` template strategy when you deploy {ProductShortName} within a production environment.
====

Elasticsearch is a memory intensive application. The initial set of nodes created by the {product-title} installation may not be large enough to support the Elasticsearch cluster. Additional nodes must be added to the cluster if you want to run with the recommended amount (or more) memory. Each Elasticsearch node can operate with a lower memory setting though this is not recommended for production deployments.

You should modify the default Elasticsearch configuration to match your use case. You can adjust both the CPU and memory limits for each component by modifying the resources block with valid memory and CPU values.

For production use, you should have no less than 16Gi allocated to each Pod by default, but preferably allocate as much as you can, up to 64Gi per Pod.
