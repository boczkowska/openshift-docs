[KNOWN ISSUE]
====
If an application requires permissions to the active Service Account to access the OpenShift namespace and delete active / current pods, an error may occur when looking at `odo log` from the backend component:

----
Message: Forbidden!Configured service account doesn't have access. Service account may have been revoked..]
----

Add permissions for the Service Account role:

----
$ oc policy add-role-to-group view system:serviceaccounts -n <project>
$ oc policy add-role-to-group edit system:serviceaccounts -n <project>
----
Doing it on a product cluster is *not* recommended.
