= External controller and provisioner

The controller and provisioner provide volume snapshotting. These external components run in the cluster.

There are two external components that provide volume snapshotting:

External controller::
Creates, deletes, and reports events on volume snapshots.
External provisioner::
Creates new PersistentVolumes from VolumeSnapshots.

The external controller and provisioner services are distributed as container images and can be run in the {product-title} cluster as usual.
