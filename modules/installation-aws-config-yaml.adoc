= Sample customized `install-config.yaml` file for AWS

You can customize the `install-config.yaml` file to specify more details about
your {product-title} cluster's platform or modify the values of the required
parameters.

[IMPORTANT]
====
This sample YAML file is provided for reference only. You must obtain your
`install-config.yaml` file by using the installation program and modify it.

----
<1> Required. The installation program prompts you for this value.
<2> If you do not provide these parameters and values, the installation program
provides the default value.
<3> The `controlPlane` section is a single mapping, but the compute section is a
sequence of mappings. To meet the requirements of the different data structures,
the first line of the `compute` section must begin with a hyphen, `-`, and the
first line of the `controlPlane` section must not. Although both sections
currently define a single machine pool, it is possible that future versions
of {product-title} will support defining multiple compute pools during
installation. Only one control plane pool is used.
<4> Whether to enable or disable simultaneous multithreading, or
`hyperthreading`. By default, simultaneous multithreading is enabled
to increase the performance of your machines' cores. You can disable it by
setting the parameter value to `Disabled`. If you disable simultaneous
multithreading in some cluster machines, you must disable it in all cluster
machines.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
If you disable simultaneous multithreading, ensure that your capacity planning
accounts for the dramatically decreased machine performance. Use larger
instance types, such as `m4.2xlarge` or `m5.2xlarge`, for your machines if you
disable simultaneous multithreading.
====
<5> To configure faster storage for etcd, especially for larger clusters, set the
storage type as `io1` and set `iops` to `2000`.
<6> You can optionally provide the `sshKey` value that you use to access the
machines in your cluster.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery on, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installation program.
