= Creating the installation configuration file

You can customize your installation of {product-title} on a compatible cloud.

.Prerequisites

* Obtain the {product-title} installation program and the pull secret for your cluster.

.Procedure

. Create the `install-config.yaml` file.
.. Run the following command:
+
----
$ ./openshift-install create install-config --dir=<installation_directory> <1>
----
<1> For `<installation_directory>`, specify the directory name to store the
files that the installation program creates.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Specify an empty directory. Some installation assets, like bootstrap X.509
certificates have short expiration intervals, so you must not reuse an
installation directory. If you want to reuse individual files from another
cluster installation, you can copy them into your directory. However, the file
names for the installation assets might change between releases. Use caution
when copying installation files from an earlier {product-title} version.
====
.. At the prompts, provide the configuration details for your cloud:
... Optional: Select an SSH key to use to access your cluster machines.
+
[NOTE]
====
For production {product-title} clusters on which you want to perform installation
debugging or disaster recovery on, you must provide an SSH key that your `ssh-agent`
process uses to the installation program.
====
ifdef::aws[]
... Select *AWS* as the platform to target.
... If you do not have an Amazon Web Services (AWS) profile stored on your computer, enter the AWS
access key ID and secret access key for the user that you configured to run the
installation program.
... Select the AWS region to deploy the cluster to.
... Select the base domain for the Route53 service that you configured for your cluster.
endif::aws[]
ifdef::azure[]
... Select *azure* as the platform to target.
... If you do not have a Microsoft Azure profile stored on your computer, specify the
following Azure parameter values for your subscription and service principal:
**** *azure subscription id*: The subscription ID to use for the cluster.
Specify the `id` value in your account output.
**** *azure tenant id*: The tenant ID. Specify the `tenantId` value in your
account output.
**** *azure service principal client id*: The value of the `appId` parameter
for the service principal.
**** *azure service principal client secret*: The value of the `password`
parameter for the service principal.
... Select the region to deploy the cluster in. This list is dynamically
generated.
... Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds
to the Azure DNS Zone that you created for your cluster.
endif::azure[]
ifdef::gcp[]
... Select *gcp* as the platform to target.
... If you have not configured the service account key for your GCP account on
your computer, you must obtain it from GCP and paste the contents of the file
or enter the absolute path to the file.
... Select the project ID to provision the cluster in. The default value is
specified by the service account that you configured.
... Select the region to deploy the cluster in.
... Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. The base domain corresponds
to the public DNS zone that you created for your cluster.
endif::gcp[]
ifdef::osp[]
.. Select *openstack* as the platform to target.
.. Specify the OpenStack external network name to use for installing the cluster.
.. Specify the Floating IP address to use for external access to the OpenShift API.
.. Specify the OpenStack flavor with at least 16 GB RAM to use for control plane
and compute nodes.
.. Select the base domain to deploy the cluster to. All DNS records will be
sub-domains of this base and will also include the cluster name.
endif::osp[]
... Enter a descriptive name for your cluster.
ifdef::azure[]

[IMPORTANT]
====
All Azure resources that are available through public endpoints are subject to
resource name restrictions, and you cannot create resources that use certain
terms. For a list of terms that Azure restricts, see
link:https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-manager-reserved-resource-name[Resolve reserved resource name errors]
in the Azure documentation.
====
endif::azure[]
ifdef::gcp[]
If you provide a name that is longer
than 6 characters, only the first 6 characters will be used in the infrastructure
ID that is generated from the cluster name.
endif::gcp[]
... Paste the pull secret that you obtained from the
link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install[OpenShift Infrastructure Providers] page.

. Modify the `install-config.yaml` file. You can find more information about
the available parameters in the *Installation configuration parameters* section
and in the
link:https://godoc.org/github.com/openshift/installer/pkg/types#InstallConfig[Go documentation].

. Back up the `install-config.yaml` file so that you can use
it to install multiple clusters.
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
The `install-config.yaml` file is consumed during the installation process. If
you want to reuse the file, you must back it up now.
