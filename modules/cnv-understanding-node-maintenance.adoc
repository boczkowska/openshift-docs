= Understanding node maintenance mode

Placing a node into maintenance marks the node as unschedulable and drains all 
the virtual machines and pods from it. Virtual machine instances that have a 
`LiveMigrate` eviction strategy are live migrated to another node without loss 
of service. This eviction strategy is configured by default in virtual machine 
created from common templates but must be configured manually for custom 
virtual machines. 

Virtual machine instances without an eviction strategy will be deleted on the 
node and recreated on another node. 

[NOTE]
====
NFS shared volumes, CephFS volumes, and Ceph RADOS Block Devices (RBDs) are the
only shared data volume type that are supported for live migration in {CNVProductName} 2.1.
