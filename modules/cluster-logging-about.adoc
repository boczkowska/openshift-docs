= About cluster logging

ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to
aggregate logs for a range of {product-title} services.

The cluster logging components are based upon Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana
(EFK). The collector, link:http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd], is
deployed to each node in the {product-title} cluster. It collects all node and
container logs and writes them to
link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] (ES).
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana] is
the centralized, web UI where users and administrators can create rich
visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.

{product-title} cluster administrators can deploy cluster logging using a few
CLI commands and the {product-title}  web console to install the Elasticsearch
Operator and Cluster Logging Operator. When the operators are installed, create
a Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR) to schedule cluster logging pods and
other resources necessary to support cluster logging. The operators are
responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining cluster logging.

As an {product-title} cluster administrator, you can deploy cluster logging to
aggregate logs for your applications.

The cluster logging components are based upon Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana
(EFK). The collector, link:http://www.fluentd.org/architecture[Fluentd], is
deployed to each node in the {product-title} cluster. It collects application
logs and writes them to
link:https://www.elastic.co/products/elasticsearch[Elasticsearch] (ES).
link:https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/kibana/current/introduction.html[Kibana] is
the centralized, web UI where users and administrators can create rich
visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data.

{product-title} cluster administrators can deploy Cluster Logging and
Elasticsearch operators via OperatorHub and configure logging in the
`openshift-logging` namespace. Configuring logging will deploy Elasticsearch,
Fluentd, and Kibana in the `openshift-logging` namespace. The operators are
responsible for deploying, upgrading, and maintaining cluster logging.
endif::[]

You can configure cluster logging by modifying the Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR), named `instance`.
The CR defines a complete cluster logging deployment that includes all the components
of the logging stack to collect, store and visualize logs.  The Cluster Logging Operator watches the `ClusterLogging`
Custom Resource and adjusts the logging deployment accordingly.

Administrators and application developers can view the logs of the projects for which they have view access.
