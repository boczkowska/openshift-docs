= Adding Source Clone Secrets

Builder Pods require access to any Git repositories defined as source for a
build. Source clone secrets are used to provide the builder Pod with access it
would not normally have access to, such as private repositories or repositories
with self-signed or untrusted SSL certificates.

.Prerequisites

* The following source clone secret configurations are supported.
** .gitconfig File
** Basic Authentication
** SSH Key Authentication
** Trusted Certificate Authorities

[NOTE]
====
You can also use combinations of these configurations
to meet your specific needs.
