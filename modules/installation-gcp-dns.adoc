= Configuring DNS for GCP

To install {product-title}, the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) account you use must
have a dedicated public hosted zone in the same project that you host the
{product-title} cluster. This zone must be authoritative for the domain. The
DNS service provides cluster DNS resolution and name lookup for external
connections to the cluster.

.Procedure

. Create a project to host your {product-title} cluster. See
link:https://cloud.google.com/resource-manager/docs/creating-managing-projects[Creating and Managing Projects]
in the GCP documentation.

. Identify your domain, or subdomain, and registrar. You can transfer an existing domain and
registrar or obtain a new one through GCP or another source.
+
[NOTE]
====
If you purchase a new domain, it can take time for the relevant DNS
changes to propagate. For more information about purchasing domains
through Google, see link:https://domains.google/[Google Domains].
====

. Create a public hosted zone for your domain or subdomain. See
link:https://cloud.google.com/dns/zones/#creating_public_zones[Creating public zones]
in the GCP documentation.
+
Use an appropriate root domain, such as `openshiftcorp.com`, or subdomain,
such as `clusters.openshiftcorp.com`.

. Extract the new authoritative name servers from the hosted zone records. See
link:https://cloud.google.com/dns/docs/update-name-servers#look_up_your_name_servers[Look up your Cloud DNS name servers]
in the GCP documentation.
+
You typically have four name servers.

. Update the registrar records for the name servers that your domain
uses. For example, if you registered your domain to Google Domains, see the
following topic in the Google Domains Help:
link:https://support.google.com/domains/answer/3290309?hl=en[How to switch to custom name servers].

. If you use a subdomain, follow your company's procedures to add its delegation
records to the parent domain.
