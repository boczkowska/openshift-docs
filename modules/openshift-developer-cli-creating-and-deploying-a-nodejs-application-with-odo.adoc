= Creating a Node.js application with {odo-title} 

{odo-title} allows quick and simple creation and deployment of applications in OpenShift clusters.

.Prerequisites

//* xref:/installing-odo.adoc[{odo-title} is installed].
* {odo-title} is installed
* A running OpenShift cluster.
** For quick deployment of a local OpenShift 3.11 cluster, recommended solution is link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_container_development_kit/3.9/[Container Development Kit (CDK)]
** For quick deployment of a local OpenShift 4.2 cluster, recommended solution is link:https://cloud.redhat.com/openshift/install/crc/installer-provisioned?intcmp=7013a000002CtetAAC[CodeReady Containers (CRC)]

.Logging into an OpenShift cluster with CDK:

. Run CDK:
+
----
$ minishift start
----
. Log into the OpenShift cluster:
+
----
$ odo login -u developer -p developer
----
+
[NOTE]
====
To make full use of {odo-title} functionality, enable the OpenShift link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/service_catalog/index.html[Service Catalog]. 
====

* If you do not use CDK, {odo-title} automatically works with any OpenShift cluster you are currently logged into. To log into the OpenShift cluster run:
+
----
$ odo login -u developer -p developer
----

.Logging into an OpenShift cluster with CRC:

. Create a local CRC virtual machine:
+
----
$ crc start
----
+
NOTE: `crc start` output contains user login and password needed for logging into the cluster. 

. Add the cached `oc` binary to your PATH:

.. Run the crc oc-env command to print the command needed to add the cached oc binary to your PATH:
+
----
$ crc oc-env
----

.. Run the printed command.

. Log into the OpenShift cluster with the provided login and password:
+
----
$ oc login -u <login> -p <password> https://api.crc.testing:6443
----

.Creating and deploying a sample Node.js application

. An application is an umbrella that comprises of all the components you build. To create a component:

.. Download the sample application and change directory to the location of the application:
+
----
$ git clone https://github.com/openshift/nodejs-ex
$ cd nodejs-ex
----
.. Add a component of the type nodejs to the application:
+
----
$ odo create nodejs
----
+
NOTE: By default, the latest image is used. You can also explicitly supply an image version by using `odo create openshift/nodejs:8`.

.. Push the initial source code to the component:
+
----
$ odo push
----
+
Your component is now deployed to OpenShift.
. Create a URL and add an entry in the local configuration file as follows:
+
----
$ odo url create --port 8080
----
+
. Push the changes. This creates a URL on the cluster.
+
----
$ odo push
----
+
. List the URLs to check the desired URL for the component.
+
----
$ odo url list
----
+
. View your deployed application using the generated URL.
+
----
$ curl <URL>
----
