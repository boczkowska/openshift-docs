= Deleting Operators from a cluster using the web console

To delete an installed Operator from the selected namespace through the web
console, follow these steps:

.Procedure

. From the *Operators* â†’ *Installed Operators* page, scroll or type a keyword into
the *Filter by name* to find the Operator you want. Then, click on it.

. On the right-hand side of the *Operator Details* page, select *Uninstall
Operator* from the *Actions* drop-down menu.

. When prompted by the *Remove Operator Subscription* window, optionally select the
*Also completely remove the Operator from the selected namespace*
check box if you want all components related to the installation to be removed.
This removes the CSV, which in turn removes the Pods, Deployments, CRDs, and CRs
associated with the Operator.

. Select *Remove*. This Operator will stop running and no longer receive updates.
