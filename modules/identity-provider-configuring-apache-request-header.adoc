= Configuring Apache authentication using request header

This example configures an authentication proxy on the same host as the master.
Having the proxy and master on the same host is merely a convenience and may not
be suitable for your environment. For example, if you were already
running a router
on the master, port 443 would not be available.

It is also important to note that while this reference configuration uses
Apache's `mod_auth_gssapi`, it is by no means required and other proxies can
easily be used if the following requirements are met:

1. Block the `X-Remote-User` header from client requests to prevent spoofing.
2. Enforce client certificate authentication in the `RequestHeaderIdentityProvider` configuration.
3. Require the `X-Csrf-Token` header be set for all authentication request using the challenge flow.
4. Only the `/oauth/authorize` endpoint and its subpaths should be proxied,
and redirects should not be rewritten to allow the backend server to send the client to the correct
location.
5. The URL that proxies to `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize` must end with `/authorize` (with no trailing slash). For example:
  * `\https://proxy.example.com/login-proxy/authorize?...` -> `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize?...`
6. Subpaths of the URL that proxies to `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize` must proxy to subpaths of `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize`. For example:
  * `\https://proxy.example.com/login-proxy/authorize/approve?...` -> `\https://<master>/oauth/authorize/approve?...`

. Obtain the `mod_auth_gssapi` module from the
link:https://access.redhat.com/solutions/392003[Optional channel].
Install the following packages:
+
----
# yum install -y httpd mod_ssl mod_session apr-util-openssl mod_auth_gssapi
----

. Generate a CA for validating requests that submit the trusted header. Use this CA
as the file name for `clientCA` in the identity provider configuration.
+
----
# oc adm ca create-signer-cert \
  --cert='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt' \
  --key='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.key' \
  --name='openshift-proxy-signer@1432232228' \
  --serial='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.serial.txt'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
The `oc adm ca create-signer-cert` command generates a certificate that is valid
for five years. This can be altered with the `--expire-days` option, but for
security reasons, it is recommended to not make it greater than this
value.

// Run `oc adm` commands only from the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
// by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.
====

. Generate a client certificate for the proxy. You can generate this certificate
by using any x509 certificate tooling, including the `oc adm` CLI:
+
----
# oc adm create-api-client-config \
  --certificate-authority='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt' \
  --client-dir='/etc/origin/master/proxy' \
  --signer-cert='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt' \
  --signer-key='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.key' \
  --signer-serial='/etc/origin/master/proxyca.serial.txt' \
  --user='system:proxy' <1>

# pushd /etc/origin/master
# cp master.server.crt /etc/pki/tls/certs/localhost.crt <2>
# cp master.server.key /etc/pki/tls/private/localhost.key
# cp ca.crt /etc/pki/CA/certs/ca.crt
# cat proxy/system\:proxy.crt \
  proxy/system\:proxy.key > \
  /etc/pki/tls/certs/authproxy.pem
# popd
----
<1> The user name can be anything, however it is useful to give it a descriptive
name as it will appear in logs.
<2> When running the authentication proxy on a different host name than the
master, it is important to generate a certificate that matches the host name
instead of using the default master certificate as shown above. The value for
`masterPublicURL` in the *_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file
must be included in the `X509v3 Subject Alternative Name` in the certificate
that is specified for `SSLCertificateFile`. If a new certificate needs to be
created, the `oc adm ca create-server-cert` command can be used.
+
[NOTE]
====
The `oc adm create-api-client-config` command generates a certificate that is
valid for two years. This can be altered with the `--expire-days` option, but
for security reasons, it is recommended to not make it greater than
this value.
Run `oc adm` commands only from the first master listed in the Ansible host inventory file,
by default *_/etc/ansible/hosts_*.

===== Configuring Apache

This proxy does not have to reside on the same
host as the master. It uses a client certificate to connect to the master, which
is configured to trust the `X-Remote-User` header.

. Create the certificate for the Apache configuration. The certificate that you
specify as the `SSLProxyMachineCertificateFile` parameter value is the proxy's
client cert that is used to authenticate the proxy to the server. It must use
`TLS Web Client Authentication` as the extended key type.


. Create the Apache configuration. Use the following template to provide your
required settings and values:
+
[IMPORTANT]
====
Carefully review the template and customize its contents to fit your
environment.

===== Configuring the master

The `identityProviders` stanza in the
*_/etc/origin/master/master-config.yaml_* file must be updated as well:

----
  identityProviders:
  - name: requestheader
    challenge: true
    login: true
    provider:
      apiVersion: v1
      kind: RequestHeaderIdentityProvider
      challengeURL: "https://[MASTER]/challenging-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}"
      loginURL: "https://[MASTER]/login-proxy/oauth/authorize?${query}"
      clientCA: /etc/origin/master/proxyca.crt
      headers:
      - X-Remote-User
----

[discrete]
===== Restarting services

Finally, restart the following services:

----
# systemctl restart httpd
# master-restart api
# master-restart controllers
----

[discrete]
===== Verifying the configuration

. Test by bypassing the proxy. You should be able to request a token if you
supply the correct client certificate and header:
+
----
# curl -L -k -H "X-Remote-User: joe" \
   --cert /etc/pki/tls/certs/authproxy.pem \
   https://[MASTER]:8443/oauth/token/request
----

. If you do not supply the client certificate, the request should be denied:
+
----
# curl -L -k -H "X-Remote-User: joe" \
   https://[MASTER]:8443/oauth/token/request
----

. This should show a redirect to the configured `challengeURL` (with
additional query parameters):
+
----
# curl -k -v -H 'X-Csrf-Token: 1' \
   '<masterPublicURL>/oauth/authorize?client_id=openshift-challenging-client&response_type=token'
----

. This should show a 401 response with a `WWW-Authenticate` basic challenge, a
negotiate challenge, or both challenges:
+
----
#  curl -k -v -H 'X-Csrf-Token: 1' \
    '<redirected challengeURL from step 3 +query>'
----

. Test logging in to the `oc` command line with and without using a Kerberos ticket:
.. If you generated a Kerberos ticket by using `kinit`, destroy it:
+
----
# kdestroy -c cache_name <1>
----
<1> Provide the name of your Kerberos cache.
.. Log in to the `oc` command line by using your Kerberos credentials:
+
----
# oc login
----
+
Enter your Kerberos user name and password at the prompt.
.. Log out of the `oc` command line:
+
----
# oc logout
----
.. Use your Kerberos credentials to get a ticket:
+
----
# kinit
----
+
Enter your Kerberos user name and password at the prompt.
.. Confirm that you can log in to the `oc` command line:
+
----
# oc login
----
+
If your configuration is correct, you are logged in without entering separate
credentials.
