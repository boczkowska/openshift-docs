= Deleting Operators from a cluster using the CLI

Instead of using the {product-title} web console, you can delete an Operator
from your cluster by using the CLI. You do this by deleting the Subscription and
CSV from the target namespace.

.Prerequisites

- Access to an {product-title} cluster using an account with
ifdef::openshift-enterprise,openshift-origin[]
`cluster-admin` permissions.
endif::[]
ifdef::openshift-dedicated[]
`dedicated-admins-cluster` permissions.
endif::[]
- Install the `oc` command on your local system.

.Procedure

. Check the current version of the subscribed Operator (for example, `jaeger`)
in the `currentCSV` field:
+
----
$ oc get subscription jaeger -n openshift-operators -o yaml | grep currentCSV
  currentCSV: jaeger-operator.v1.8.2
----

. Delete the Operator's Subscription (for example, `jaeger`):
+
----
$ oc delete subscription jaeger -n openshift-operators
subscription.operators.coreos.com "jaeger" deleted
----

. Delete the CSV for the Operator in the target namespace using the `currentCSV`
value from the previous step:
+
----
$ oc delete clusterserviceversion jaeger-operator.v1.8.2 -n openshift-operators
clusterserviceversion.operators.coreos.com "jaeger-operator.v1.8.2" deleted
----
