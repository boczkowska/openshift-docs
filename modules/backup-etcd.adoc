= Backing up etcd data

Follow these steps to back up etcd data by creating a snapshot. This snapshot can be saved and used at a later time if you need to restore etcd.

You should only save a snapshot from a single master host. You do not need a snapshot from each master host in the cluster.

.Prerequisites

* SSH access to a master host.

.Procedure

. Access a master host as the root user.

. Run the `etcd-snapshot-backup.sh` script and pass in the location to save the etcd snapshot to.
+
----
$ sudo /usr/local/bin/etcd-snapshot-backup.sh ./assets/backup/snapshot.db
----
+
In this example, the snapshot is saved to `./assets/backup/snapshot.db` on the master host.
