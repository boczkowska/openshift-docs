= Adding a Pod to an additional network

You can add a Pod to an additional network. {product-title} will continue using
the primary network for normal cluster related network traffic.

.Prerequisites

* Install the OpenShift Command-line Interface (CLI), commonly known as `oc`.
* You must log in to the cluster.

.Procedure

To add a Pod to an additional network, complete the following steps:

. Edit the Pod resource definition. If you are editing an existing Pod, run the
following command to edit its definition in the default editor. Replace `<name>`
with the name of the Pod to edit.
+
----
$ oc edit pod <name>
----

. In the Pod resource definition, add the `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`
parameter to the Pod `metadata` mapping. The `k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks`
accepts a comma separated string of one or more `AdditionalNetworkDefinition`
names:
+
[source,yaml] 
----
metadata:
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: <network>[,<network>,...] <1>
----
<1> Replace `<network>` with the name of the additional network to associate
with the Pod. To specify more than one additional network, separate each network
with a comma. Do not include whitespace between the comma. If you specify
the same additional network multiple times, that Pod will have multiple network
interfaces attached to that network.
+
In the following example, two additional networks are attached to the Pod:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: example-pod
  annotations:
    k8s.v1.cni.cncf.io/networks: net1,net2
spec:
  containers:
  - name: example-pod
    command: ["/bin/bash", "-c", "sleep 2000000000000"]
    image: centos/tools
----

. Optional: Confirm that the annotation exists in the Pod CR by running the
following command:
+
----
$ oc describe pod <name>
----
