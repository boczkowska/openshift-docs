= Running the scorecard with an OLM-managed Operator

The scorecard can be run using a ClusterServiceVersion (CSV), providing a way to
test cluster-ready and non-SDK Operators.

.Prerequisites

* Running with a CSV alone requires both the `csv-path: <csv_manifest_path>` and
`olm-deployed` options to be set. The scorecard assumes your CSV and relevant
CRDs have been deployed onto the cluster using OLM when using `olm-deployed`.
* The scorecard requires a proxy container in the Operator's `Deployment` Pod to
read Operator logs. A few modifications to your CSV and creation of one extra
object are required to run the proxy _before_ deploying your Operator with OLM.

.Procedure

. Create a proxy server secret containing a local Kubeconfig:

.. Generate a user name using the scorecard proxy's namespaced owner reference.
+
----
$ echo '{"apiVersion":"","kind":"","name":"scorecard","uid":"","Namespace":"'<namespace>'"}' | base64 -w 0 <1>
----
<1> Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace your Operator was deployed in, if any.

.. Write a `Config` manifest `scorecard-config.yaml` using the following template,
replacing `<username>` with the base64 user name generated in the previous
step:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Config
clusters:
- cluster:
    insecure-skip-tls-verify: true
    server: http://<username>@localhost:8889
  name: proxy-server
contexts:
- context:
    cluster: proxy-server
    user: admin/proxy-server
  name: <namespace>/proxy-server
current-context: <namespace>/proxy-server
preferences: {}
users:
- name: admin/proxy-server
  user:
    username: <username>
    password: unused
----

.. Encode the `Config` as base64:
+
----
$ cat scorecard-config.yaml | base64 -w 0
----

.. Create a `Secret` manifest `scorecard-secret.yaml`:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: scorecard-kubeconfig
  namespace: <namespace> <1>
data:
  kubeconfig: <kubeconfig_base64> <2>
----
<1> Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace your Operator was deployed in, if any.
<2> Replace `<kubeconfig_base64>` with the `Config` encoded as base64.

.. Apply the secret:
+
----
$ oc apply -f scorecard-secret.yaml
----

.. Insert a volume referring to the `Secret` into the Operator's Deployment:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  install:
    spec:
      deployments:
      - name: memcached-operator
        spec:
          ...
          template:
            ...
            spec:
              containers:
              ...
              volumes:
              - name: scorecard-kubeconfig <1>
                secret:
                  secretName: scorecard-kubeconfig
                  items:
                  - key: kubeconfig
                    path: config
----
<1> Scorecard `kubeconfig` volume.

. Insert a volume mount and `KUBECONFIG` environment variable into each container
in your Operator's Deployment:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  install:
    spec:
      deployments:
      - name: memcached-operator
        spec:
          ...
          template:
            ...
            spec:
              containers:
              - name: container1
                ...
                volumeMounts:
                - name: scorecard-kubeconfig <1>
                  mountPath: /scorecard-secret
                env:
                - name: KUBECONFIG <2>
                  value: /scorecard-secret/config
              - name: container2 <3>
                ...
----
<1> Scorecard `kubeconfig` volume mount.
<2> Scorecard `kubeconfig` environment variable.
<3> Repeat the same for this and all other containers.

. Insert the scorecard proxy container into the Operator's Deployment:
+
[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  install:
    spec:
      deployments:
      - name: memcached-operator
        spec:
          ...
          template:
            ...
            spec:
              containers:
              ...
              - name: scorecard-proxy <1>
                command:
                - scorecard-proxy
                env:
                - name: WATCH_NAMESPACE
                  valueFrom:
                    fieldRef:
                      apiVersion: v1
                      fieldPath: metadata.namespace
                image: quay.io/operator-framework/scorecard-proxy:master
                imagePullPolicy: Always
                ports:
                - name: proxy
                  containerPort: 8889
----
<1> Scorecard proxy container.

[TIP]
====
Alternatively, the
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators[`community-operators`]
repository has several bash functions that can perform this procedure for you:

----
$ curl -Lo csv-manifest-modifiers.sh \
    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/operator-framework/community-operators/master/scripts/lib/file
$ . ./csv-manifest-modifiers.sh
$ create_kubeconfig_secret_file scorecard-secret.yaml "<namespace>" <1>
$ oc apply -f scorecard-secret.yaml
$ insert_kubeconfig_volume "<csv_file>" <2>
$ insert_kubeconfig_secret_mount "<csv_file>"
$ insert_proxy_container "<csv_file>" "quay.io/operator-framework/scorecard-proxy:master"
----
<1> Replace `<namespace>` with the namespace your Operator was deployed in.
<2> Replace `<csv_file>` with the path to your Operator's CSV manifest.
====

After completing this procedure, follow the steps in
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/community-operators/blob/master/docs/testing-operators.md[Testing your Operator with Operator Framework]
to bundle your CSV and CRDs, deploy OLM on minikube or
link:https://www.okd.io/[OKD], and deploy your Operator.

After your Operator has been deployed, run the scorecard with both the
`csv-path: <csv_manifest_path>` and `olm-deployed` options set.

[NOTE]
====
Currently, using the scorecard with a CSV does not permit multiple CR manifests
to be set through the CLI, configuration file, or CSV annotations. You must tear
down your Operator in the cluster, re-deploy, and re-run the scorecard for each
CR that is tested.
====

[NOTE]
====
You can either set `cr-manifest` or your CSV's
link:https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/blob/master/doc/design/building-your-csv.md#crd-templates[`metadata.annotations['alm-examples'\]`]
to provide CRs to the scorecard, but not both.
