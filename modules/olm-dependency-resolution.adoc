= Dependency resolution and upgrades

OLM manages the dependency resolution and upgrade lifecycle of running
Operators. In many ways, the problems OLM faces are similar to other operating
system package managers like `yum` and `rpm`.

However, there is one constraint that similar systems do not generally have that
OLM does: because Operators are always running, OLM attempts to ensure that you
are never left with a set of Operators that do not work with each other.

This means that OLM must never:

- install a set of Operators that require APIs that cannot be provided, or
- update an Operator in a way that breaks another that depends upon it.

// The following examples motivate why OLM's dependency resolution and upgrade strategy works as it does, followed by a description of the current algorithm.

== Custom Resource Definition (CRD) upgrades

OLM upgrades a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) immediately if it is owned by a
singular Cluster Service Version (CSV). If a CRD is owned by multiple CSVs, then
the CRD is upgraded when it has satisfied all of the following backward
compatible conditions:

- All existing serving versions in current the CRD are present in the new CRD.
- All existing instances, or Custom Resources (CRs), that are associated with the
serving versions of the CRD are valid when validated against the new CRD's
validation schema.

=== Adding a new CRD version

.Procedure

To add a new version of a CRD:

. Add a new entry in the CRD resource under the `versions` section.
+
For example, if the current CRD has one version `v1alpha1` and you want to add a
new version `v1beta1` and mark it as the new storage version:
+
[source,yaml]
----
versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: true
    storage: false
  - name: v1beta1 <1>
    served: true
    storage: true
----
<1> Add a new entry for `v1beta1`.

. Ensure the referencing version of the CRD in your CSV's `owned` section is
updated if the CSV intends to use the new version:
+
[source,yaml]
----
customresourcedefinitions:
  owned:
  - name: cluster.example.com
    version: v1beta1 <1>
    kind: cluster
    displayName: Cluster
----
<1> Update the `version`.

. Push the updated CRD and CSV to your bundle.

[id="olm-dependency-resolution-removing-crd-version_{context}"]
=== Deprecating or removing a CRD version

OLM does not allow a serving version of a CRD to be removed right away. Instead,
a deprecated version of the CRD must be first disabled by setting the `served`
field in the CRD to `false`. Then, the non-serving version can be removed on the
subsequent CRD upgrade.

.Procedure

To deprecate and remove a specific version of a CRD:

. Mark the deprecated version as non-serving to indicate this version is no longer
in use and may be removed in a subsequent upgrade. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: false <1>
    storage: true
----
<1> Set to `false`.

. Switch the `storage` version to a serving version if the version to be
deprecated is currently the `storage` version. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
versions:
  - name: v1alpha1
    served: false
    storage: false <1>
  - name: v1beta1
    served: true
    storage: true <1>
----
<1> Update the `storage` fields accordingly.
+
[NOTE]
====
In order to remove a specific version that is or was the `storage` version from
a CRD, that version must be removed from the `storedVersion` in the CRD's
status. OLM will attempt to do this for you if it detects a stored version no
longer exists in the new CRD.
====

. Upgrade the CRD with the above changes.

. In subsequent upgrade cycles, the non-serving version can be removed completely
from the CRD. For example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
versions:
  - name: v1beta1
    served: true
    storage: true
----

. Ensure the referencing version of the CRD in your CSV’s `owned` section is
updated accordingly if that version is removed from the CRD.

== Example dependency resolution scenarios

In the following examples, a _provider_ is an Operator which "owns" a CRD or
APIService.

[discrete]
=== Example: Deprecating dependent APIs

A and B are APIs (e.g., CRDs):

* A's provider depends on B.
* B’s provider has a Subscription.
* B’s provider updates to provide C but deprecates B.

This results in:

* B no longer has a provider.
* A no longer works.

This is a case OLM prevents with its upgrade strategy.

[discrete]
=== Example: Version deadlock

A and B are APIs:

* A's provider requires B.
* B's provider requires A.
* A's provider updates to (provide A2, require B2) and deprecate A.
* B's provider updates to (provide B2, require A2) and deprecate B.

If OLM attempts to update A without simultaneously updating B, or vice-versa, it
is unable to progress to new versions of the Operators, even though a new
compatible set can be found.

This is another case OLM prevents with its upgrade strategy.
