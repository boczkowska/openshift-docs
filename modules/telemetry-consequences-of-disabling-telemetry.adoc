= Consequences of disabling Telemetry

In {product-title} {product-version}, customers can opt out of the Telemetry service. However, Telemetry is embedded as a core component and serves as part of the overall function of the cluster. Therefore, opting out is strongly discouraged.

Some of the consequences of opting out of Telemetry are:

* The Red Hat OpenShift Cluster Manager does not work as expected and does not show critical information about your clusters.
* You cannot perform subscription management, including legally entitling your purchase from Red Hat through `cloud.redhat.com`. Because there is no disconnected subscription management, you cannot both opt out of sending data to Red Hat and entitle your purchase.
* You will not gain quality assurance by reporting faults encountered during upgrades.
* You cannot entitle your cluster.

Deployment and management of {product-title} for restricted networks is a critical goal and will be delivered in a future version of {product-title}.
